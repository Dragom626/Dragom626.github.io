Slow Pusher - This is Phil and his army of other Phil's, they are very slow at pushing buttons.
Robo Pusher - Out with Phil and in with PhilBot2000 working without complaining.
Cyborg Pusher - Fusing Phil and the PhilBot2000 creates a better and faster button pusher.
Optic Pusher - The eyes of the cyborg are the best pushing your buttons even faster then before.
Arcane Pusher - We don't know what happened down at the lab but this floating light pushes lots of buttons.
